## Writing logical statements



## Truth

Let *h* = "Maria is healthy", *w* = "Maria is wealthy", and *z* = "Maria is wise." Write each of the following compound statements:

- Maria is healthy and wealthy but not wise.
- Maria is not healthy but she is wealthy and wise.
- Maria is neither healthy, wealthy, nor wise.
- Maria is neither healthy nor wise, but she is wealthy.
- Maria is wealthy, but she is not both healthy and wise.

Draw a truth table for each of the following statements:

- *p* ∧ ¬*q*
- *p* ∨ (*q* ∧ ¬*r*)
- ¬(*p* ∧ *q*)
- *p* ∧ ¬(*q* → *r*)
- (*p* → (*q* → *r*)) ↔ ((*p* ∧ *q*) → *r*



## Let's talk about sexagesimals

The ancient Babylonians used a **base-60** number system. For example, the Babylonian number

```
15 ; 45
```

would be equivalent to

```
15 * 60 _+ 45
```

# Sprint 1 &ndash; Logic, Sets, and Languages
## Starts Monday 8/21
## Deliverables are due on Friday 9/1

## Overview and Goals

The goal of our first unit is to review key background material on discrete math and introduce a few of the major concepts we'll be working with throughout the semester. You'll also get to practice working working with the course text. At the end of this spring, you'll be familiar (or re-familiar) with the following concepts:

- Propositional logic: variables, conjunction, disjunction, negation
- Truth tables as tool for reasoning about propositions
- Using the rules of Boolean algebra to manipulate propositions and show their equivalence
- Conditional propositions
- Core concepts of set theory and set notation
- Operations on sets: union, intersection, difference
- Binary and hexadecimal numbers; conversions between bases
- Bitwise operators
- *Languages* in theoretical CS, which we'll return to repeatedly throughout the semester


## Deliverables

Complete the problems in the `Deliverables.md` file. Put all of your solutions into one document and upload it to Canvas at the assignment I'll create for you.

## AI Usage

AI tools will be useful for helping you understand concepts and definitions. Experiment with asking an AI tool to act as a tutor and provide you with explanations and questions that can test your understanding. Here's an example prompt:

*You are a friendly and helpful tutor who provides clear explanations of concepts in theoretical computer science. I'm learning about <CONCEPT>. I'd like you to provide a high-level overview of that topic, then ask me 3-5 follow-up questions I can use to assess my own understanding.*
  
You can then answer one of the questions and ask the AI to provide suggestions for improving your response. I recommend using either the Bing AI or Claude.

**Don't use AI for proofs, derivations, or logical reasoning problems**. Remember that AI language models aren't really capable of symbolic reasoning. It's easy to get an answer that has the appearance of a proof, but isn't actually logically correct.

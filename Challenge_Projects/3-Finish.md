## Challenge Project 3: Finish the Interpreter

## Due 12/8

## You can work with a partner to complete this project

## Description

Complete the interpreter by implementing the `while` and `for` statements. In addition, add **one more new feature**, which can be whatever you want.

The basic strategy for the `while` loop is an extension of the `if` from the previous project: check the condition and decide whether to enter the loop or not. When the condition becomes `False`, skip around the body and advance to the next statement.

*I searched for "Touring machine" and the first result was for this $1400 Big Rock Show fog machine*.

## Overview

This is a *short* assignment to hit some of the concepts we've covered in the last week of class. Read [this article](https://www.scottaaronson.com/writings/bignumbers.html) by theoretical computer scientist Scott Aaronson about really big numbers. It touches on many of the concepts we've been exploring recently. Then answer the following questions. Put your answers in a text file and upload them to the assignment I'll create on Canvas.


## Who can name the bigger number?

- Before reading this article, what would you have entered in the biggest number challenge?

- Why is infinity not allowed as an entry?
  
- If computers cannot consider all possible chess moves exhaustively, how does a computer chess program work? Do some research.
  
- What does Moore's Law say about the rate at which information storage capacity on a single chip increases?

- Does Moore's Law always imply that computers double in speed every two years?

- Why will Moore's Law eventually stop?

- What does it mean to say that a number sequence is "computable"?

- Do some research and give an intuitive description of what it means for a sequence to be "primitive recursive".
  
- Explain the relationship between multiplication, exponentiation, tetration, and pentation.

- Do some research and give a summary of Graham's number from Ramsey theory.

- Why is the halting problem unsolvable by a Turing machine?
  
- Give the definition for the nth Busy Beaver number *BB*(*n*).
 
- How would knowing the sequence of busy beaver numbers allow us to solve the halting problem?

- Why is BB(1) = 1?
  
- It looks like the Ackermann sequence grows faster than the busy beaver sequence, at least for the values shown in the article, so why is the Ackermann sequence computable while the BB sequence is not? Tip: review the "beaver dams" argument.

- Review Stephen Kleene's argument about hierarchies of Turing machines. How is this hierarchy defined.

- What is *BB*<sub>2</sub>(*n*)?
  
- Is Aaronson cheating at his own game by using numbers that can be defined mathematically, but not actually written down as a sequence of digits?

- What *is* the use of all this?

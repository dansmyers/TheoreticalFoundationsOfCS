This micro-assignment is adapted from Raymond Smullyan's *The Riddle of Dracula*. I have changed the setting to the fictional principality of Ruritania to avoid perpetuating the harmful stereotype that Transylvania is populated by insane vampires.

## The Setting

At one time I was vacationing in the tiny European principality of Ruritania when a shocking rumor reached my ears: that Count Dracula had somehow escaped his climactic confrontation with Dr. Van Helsing and was now residing within a castle somewhere in the land I was now visiting! I decided that the fate of many souls, perhaps the entire world, depended on discovering the truth of this matter.

However, I quickly ran into a problem when I attempted to gather information concerning the Count's existence. Ruritania, you see, was populated by both humans and vampires:

- Humans always tell the truth about what they believe.
- Vampires always lie about what they believe.

This did not concern me, because I've seen the 1986 movie *Labyrinth* (starring Jennifer Connelly and David Bowie, directed by Jim Henson), and was therefore familiar with [the classic "Knights and Knaves" puzzle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReFhu8KYbmU), which has [many possible solutions](https://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0327.html).

Challenges increased, however, when I discovered a second fact: some inhabitants of Ruritania are sane, and believe what is real, and some are *insane*, and believe the opposite of whatever is real. There are therefore four kinds of Ruritanians:

- Sane humans, who believe what is real and tell the truth about what they believe
- Insane humans, who believe the opposite of what is real, but truthfully state their (incorrect) beliefs
- Sane vampires, who believe real things, but then lie about what they believe
- Insane vampires, who believe only incorrect things, but then lie about what they believe

For example, if I asked a Ruritanian, "Is the sky blue?", there are four possibilities:

- A sane human believes the sky is blue and answers truthfully, "Yes".
- An insane human says "No", because he believes the sky is *not* blue, but truthfully says what he believes
- A sane vampire believes the sky is blue, but lies about it and answers, "No"
- An insane vampire believes the sky is not blue, but lies about it and therefore answers "Yes"

## Questions

1. I asked a Ruritanian, "Are you a sane human?" and he answered, "Yes". Is he?  Tip: make a truth table for each of the four types and figure out whether that type *believes* he is a sane human and then how he would answer the questions based on the belief.

2. A Ruritanian says, "I'm an insane vampire." Is she?

3. Is it possible for a Ruritanian to say, "I'm a sane vampire"?

4. Suppose I ask, "Are you a vampire?" What can I learn by asking that question?

5. Suppose I ask, "Are you insane?" What can I learn from that question?

6. By this point, I realized that both sane humans and insane vampires make truthful statements. Therefore, I decide to begin every conversation by asking, "Are you either a sane human or an insane vampire?" Will this question allow me to identify truth-tellers?
